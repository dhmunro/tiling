  <h1>Multigrid Generation of Aperiodic Tilings</h1>

  <h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

  <p>The Penrose tiling is the classic aperiodic tiling of the plane.
    In its simplest form, it consists of two tile shapes - a thick
    rhombus with angles of 72 and 108 degrees and a thin rhombus with
    36 and 144 degree angles.  Both rhombs have the same length sides.
    Penrose marked the rhombs so that they only fit together in
    certain orientations, but there are are also complex non-local
    requirements which make fitting together a large number of tiles a
    rather hit-or-miss affair.  However, de Bruijn discovered a very
    clever deterministic way to fit together an arbitrarily large
    number of tiles without ever making any mistakes.  Here, we will
    explore generalizations of de Bruijn's pentagrid idea, leading to
    an algorithm to draw Penrose and other similar tilings.</p>

  <img style="float:right; width:50%" src="fig01.svg"
       alt="line intersections generate dual rhomb tiling" />
  <p>De Bruijn noticed that any set of intersecting lines in the plane
    defines a dual tiling as follows: Imagine an infinitessimal
    rhombus with its centroid at each intersection point and its edges
    perpendicular to the lines.  If you inflate all of these to have a
    common side length, then you can use the sequence of intersection
    points along any one line to tell you the order to fit the
    corresponding rhomb edges together to completely cover a connected
    convex region of the plane.  (If more than two lines intersect at a
    point, you can use the equilateral polygon whose edges are
    perpendicular to the lines as a single tile corresponding to that
    point - or you can decompose that even-sided convex polygon into
    rhombs by infinitessimally displacing the lines.)</p>
  <p>(See <a href="https://www.adamponting.com/de-bruijn-tilings/">
      adamponting.com/de-bruijn-tilings</a> for nicer examples.)</p>
  <p>To recap: Any set of intersecting lines determines a dual rhomb
    tiling.  Each rhomb corresponds to one intersection point, and
    each vertex in the tiling corresponds to a polygonal region
    bounded by the lines.  All the rhomb tile edges have equal lengths
    and the edges of each rhomb are perpendicular to the two lines of
    its corresponding intersection point.  Walking from point to point
    around a polygonal region in the plane of the lines corresponds to
    walking from rhomb to rhomb around a vertex in the tiling.  And
    walking around the four regions surrounding each intersection
    point corresponds to walking around the four corners of one rhomb
    in the tiling.</p>
  <p>Now <a href="https://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/M272/pentagrid.pdf">
      de Bruijn</a> looked specifically at five infinite grids of
    equally spaced parallel lines, with each set of grid lines
    parallel to one edge of a regular pentagon, and discovered that
    not only did the dual rhomb tilings satisfy the Penrose matching
    conditions, but also that every infinite Penrose tiling was dual
    to such a &ldquo;pentagrid&rdquo;.  Here we consider $n$ sets of
    parallel grid lines, first with arbitrary directions and line
    spacings, then with equal angles between the grids and equal line
    spacings more analogous to pentagrids.</p>

  <h2>Generic Algorithm for Finite Number of Lines</h2>

  <p>Before we move on to infinite sets of parallel grid lines, consider
    a collection of $n$ random lines $\ZETAH_j\cdot\VEC{x}+\gamma_j=0.$
    Generally we have $n(n-1)/2$ intersection points - one intersection
    for each pair of lines.  An algorithm to draw the dual rhomb tiling
    is fairly simple:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Loop over the $n$ lines, with line index $j$.</li>
    <li>Find the $n-1$ intersections with the other lines, with line
      index $k\ne j$.</li>
    <li>Each intersection $(j,k)$ with $j&lt;k$ will correspond to a
      rhomb with corners $\VEC{z}_{jk},$ $\VEC{z}_{jk}+\ZETAH_j,$
      $\VEC{z}_{jk}+\ZETAH_j+\ZETAH_k,$ and $\VEC{z}_{jk}+\ZETAH_k.$</li>
    <li>Sort the intersections with $j$ in order of
      $\ZETAH_j\cdot\VEC{x}.$</li>
    <li>If $j=0$, find the intersection $k$ in the middle of the
      sorted list and draw that rhomb at $\VEC{z}_{jk}=(0,0).$  For $j&gt;0,$
      the process is the same, except you begin from the $k=0$
      intersection.</li>
    <li>Step forward in the sorted list to $k',$ and if $k'&gt;j,$
      draw that rhomb at $\VEC{z}_{jk'}=\VEC{z}_{jk}+\ZETAH_k,$
      otherwise just move to that new position.</li>
    <li>After you reach the end of the sorted list, return to the
      initial $k$ and step backward, this time drawing or
      skipping the rhombs at $\VEC{z}_{jk'}=\VEC{z}_{jk}-\ZETAH_{k'}.$
    <li>Note that for $j=0$ you must keep the list of rhomb positions
      $\VEC{z}_{0k}$, indexed by $k.$ You can forget the rhomb
      locations for $j&gt;0,$ just keeping track of the current
      $\VEC{z}_{jk}.$</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The more structured infinite grids we consider next eliminate
    the need for the sorting.  However, the sort operations do not
    make these finite tilings particularly more expensive to draw
    than the grids we turn to now.</p>

  <h2>Arbitrary Grid Directions and Spacings</h2>

  <p>Consider an arbitrary set of non-zero, non-parallel two
    dimensional vectors $\{\ZETA_j\}$ for $j = 1, 2, ...,
    n,$ and $n$ grids of equally spaced parallel lines

    \[ \ZETA_j\cdot\VEC{x} + \gamma_j = k_j, \]

    where $k_j$ runs through all integer values and $\gamma_j$ is an
    arbitrary constant determining the phase of the grid lines
    relative to the origin.  Note that changing $\gamma_j$ by any
    integer value merely relabels the $k_j$ for all of the grid lines
    without changing the grid itself.  Any pair $r, s$ of grids
    generates a regular lattice of intersection points $\VEC{x}(k_r,
    k_s)$ labeled by the line indices $(k_r, k_s).$</p>
  <p>Although each $(r, s)$ pair produces a regular set of lattice
    points, when the $\ZETA_j$ are incommensurate the lattices
    corresponding to different pairs never synchronize, so the full
    pattern of $n(n-1)/2$ lattices is aperiodic.  Nevertheless, we can
    construct the dual tiling explicitly.</p>

  <p>Every point $\VEC{x}$ in the multigrid plane falls between one
    pair of $j$-lines, $k_j=K_j(\VEC{x})-1$ and
    $k_j=K_j(\VEC{x})$, which we can write using ceiling brackets:

    \[ K_j(\VEC{x}) = \lceil \ZETA_j\cdot\VEC{x}
                         + \gamma_j \rceil. \]

    We also define the fractional distance from the point $\VEC{x}$ to
    the line $K_j(\VEC{x})$, $0 &lt;= \lambda_j &lt; 1,$ where

    \[ \lambda_j(\VEC{x}) =
          K_j(\VEC{x}) - \ZETA_j\cdot\VEC{x} - \gamma_j. \]

  <p>Next, define the function

    \[ f(\VEC{x}) = \sum_j K_j(\VEC{x})\ZETAH_j, \]

    where $\ZETAH_j$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\ZETA_j.$
    The function $f$, like the $n$ functions $K_j$, is constant within
    every polygonal region of the multigrid.  Therefore, the value of
    $f$ in each region corresponds to a vertex in the dual tiling.
    For vertex $(k_r, k_s)$ in the $rs$ lattice, call the value of $f$

    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s) =
       \sum_j K_j(\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s))\ZETAH_j. \]

    Furthermore, as you walk around the intersection point
    $\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s),$ $f(\VEC{x})$ successively takes the four
    values

    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s),\quad \VEC{z}(k_r+1, k_s),\quad
       \VEC{z}(k_r+1, k_s+1),\quad \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s+1). \]

    Since crossing an $r$ (or $s$) line in the multigrid changes just
    $K_r$ (or $K_s$) by $\pm 1,$ these four values of $f$ are in fact
    the four corners of a unit-sided rhombus:

    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s),\quad \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s)+\ZETAH_r,\quad
       \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s)+\ZETAH_r+\ZETAH_s,\quad
       \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s)+\ZETAH_s \]

    Therefore, not only do the values of $f(\VEC{x})$ correspond to
    the vertices in a rhomb tiling, we can <em>identify</em> them as
    the vertices in a rhomb tiling dual to the multigrid!  All the
    rhomb sides in this tiling have unit length, and the number of
    different rhomb shapes corresponds to the number of different
    angles between $\ZETAH_r$ and $\ZETAH_s$ for all $rs$ pairs.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, we have discovered an algorithm to actually draw the
    dual tiling given the multigrid: Loop over all $n(n-1)/2$ of the
    $rs$ pairs, and draw the rhombs for each $(k_r, k_s)$ pair where
    that intersection point lies in some bounded region of the
    multigrid space.</p>
  <p>Now rewrite the formula for $\VEC{z}(k_r, k_s)$ (the corner of
    the rhomb associated with intersection point $k_r, k_s$ that has
    the smallest values of $k_r$ and $k_s$) in terms of the remainders
    $\lambda_j(k_r, k_s) = \lambda_j(\VEC{x}(k_r, k_s))$.  By
    definition $K_j(\VEC{x}(k_r, k_s)) = \ZETA_j\cdot\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s)
    + \gamma_j + \lambda_j(k_r,k_s),$ so

    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s) = \VEC{M}\cdot\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s) + \ETA
          + \sum_j\lambda_j(k_r,k_s)\ZETAH_j \]

    where we have defined the symmetric $2\times 2$ matrix $\VEC{M}$
    as the sum of outer products

    \[ \VEC{M} = \sum_j\ZETA_j\,\ZETAH_j, \]

    and the vector $\ETA$ as

    \[ \ETA = \sum_j\gamma_j\,\ZETAH_j. \]
  <p>That is, the point $\VEC{z}$ in the tiling plane is always close
    to the point $\VEC{M}\cdot\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s) + \ETA +
    \sum_j\ZETAH_j/2$, where we have added the final term as the mean
    of the possible range of values of the $\lambda_j$ sum.  Since we
    are primarily interested in the rhomb tiling, we can consider the
    sets of grid lines with the linear transform $\VEC{M}$ applied.
    This transformed multigrid will still have the same topology of
    intersection points as the original grid.  However, instead of a
    rhomb associated with each intersection point, in general the
    transform $\VEC{M}$ will distort it into a parallelogram.  In terms
    of $\VEC{x}'=\VEC{M}\cdot\VEC{x}$ the equations for the grid lines
    are

    \[ \PSI_j\cdot\VEC{x}' + \gamma_j = k_j \]

    where $\PSI_j = \VEC{M}^{-1}\cdot\ZETA_j.$  We also translate the
    definition of $\VEC{z}(k_r,k_s)$ to make it line up with $\VEC{x}'$

    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s) = \sum_j K_j(\VEC{x}(k_r,k_s))\ZETAH_j
                          - \ETA - \tfrac{1}{2}\sum_j\ZETAH_j, \]

    so that
    
    \[ \VEC{z}(k_r, k_s) = \VEC{x}'(k_r,k_s) +
                \sum_j(\lambda_j(k_r,k_s)-\tfrac{1}{2})\ZETAH_j. \]
  </p>
  <p>Since the $\lambda_j$ are always between 0 and 1, we see that the
    center of the $(k_r,k_s)$ rhomb is always near its dual point
    $\VEC{x}'(k_r,k_s).$ Furthermore, $\lambda_r(k_r,k_s)
    =\lambda_s(k_r,k_s)=0,$ so there are only $n-2$ non-zero terms in
    the displacement $\sum_j\lambda_j(k_r,k_s)\ZETAH_j.$</p>
  <p>Note that the grid intersection points can be written explicitly as

    \[ \VEC{x}'(k_r, k_s) = (k_s - \gamma_s)\PHI_{rs}
                  + (k_r - \gamma_r)\PHI_{sr} \]

    where $\PHI_{rs} = \PSI_{r\perp} / \PSI_r \times \PSI_s,$ and
    $\PSI_{r\perp}$ is $\PSI_r$ rotated ninety degrees
    counterclockwise so that $\PSI_{r\perp} \cdot \PSI_s = \PSI_r
    \times \PSI_s.$ Beware that a set of $k_j$ values uniquely
    identifies only a zone in the multigrid (or a vertex in the
    tiling) - not an intersection point in the multigrid.  A set of
    $k_j$ values may be shared by different intersection points in
    separate $(r, s)$ lattices, or by the corresponding different
    rhombs in the tiling.
  </p>

  <h2>Equally Spaced Multigrids</h2>

  <p>When the angles are equally spaced - at $n$-th roots of unity
    when $n$ is odd, or $2n$-th roots of unity when $n$ is even - and
    all $n$ grid spacings are equal, the only real simplification in
    this picture is that the matrix $\VEC{M}$ is proportional to the
    identity matrix.  In fact, $\VEC{M}=\tfrac{n}{2}\VEC{I}$ so that
    $\PSI_j=\tfrac{2}{n}\ZETAH_j.$ (We assume $\ZETA_j=\ZETAH_j$ here.)
    This means that $\VEC{x}'=\tfrac{n}{2}\VEC{x}$ is an undistorted
    version of the original multigrid.
  </p>
  <p>For the case of odd $n$, something else interesting happens.  In
    this case, $\sum_j\ZETA_j=0.$ If we additionally restrict the
    $\gamma_j$ to have the property $\sum_j\gamma_j=0,$ then since
    $K_j(\VEC{x})$ is an integer,

    \[ \begin{eqnarray*} \sum_j K_j(\VEC{x}) &=&
                  \sum_j(\ZETA_j\cdot\VEC{x} + \gamma_j)
                  + \sum_j\lambda_j(\VEC{x}) \\
            &=& \sum_j\lambda_j(\VEC{x}) \\  &=& I(\VEC{x})
    \end{eqnarray*} \]

    is also an integer for every point $\VEC{x}$ in the multigrid
    plane.  Since $0\le\lambda_j\lt 1,$ we have $I(\VEC{x})\lt n.$
    Furthermore, assuming all $n$ lines never meet at any point,
    $I(\VEC{x})\gt 0.$  The function $I(\VEC{x})$ is called the
    <em>index</em> of a point.</p>
  <p>For the $n=5$ case de Bruijn first studied, this
    $\sum_j\gamma_j=0$ restriction (equivalent to summing to any
    integer value, since shifting the $k_j$ line labels does not
    change the grid) plays an important role in his proof that the
    pentagrid construction is identical to Penrose's original edge
    matching construction.  This proof is based on the integer values
    of the index, which he can use to label the vertices in the
    tiling.  Those vertex labels can be used to reconstruct the edge
    matching conditions.  If $\sum_j\gamma_j$ has some non-zero,
    non-integer value, it is unclear what happens - the tilings
    derived from such a pentagrid still look like Penrose tilings, but
    perhaps the edge matching conditions can occasionally fail.</p>
  <p>What is the analogous vertex labeling function for even $n$?</p>
